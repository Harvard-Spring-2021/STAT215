# Part I. Chromatin Modification (3.5/5 pts)

DNA methylation patterns are altered in many diseases, including cancer, which makes this epigenetic mark an attractive target for various studies. Genome-wide detection of 5mC by bisulfite sequencing is regarded as the current gold standard for DNA methylation detection. In the HW3, we have performed the gene regulation analysis on prostate cancer using transcription factor ChIP-seq data. To better understand the effect of methylation on gene expression, we can utilize BS-seq to detect the DNA methylation positions in the genome.


**I.1 (3.5 pts) Reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS-Seq) is a technique that uses one or multiple restriction enzymes on the genomic DNA to produce sequence-specific fragmentation. The fragmented genomic DNA is then treated with bisulfite and sequenced. RRBS-Seq is particularly effective on the sites with high methylation, such as in promoters and repeat regions. Given a subsampled RRBS-seq file(`data/bs_subreads.fastq`) in a prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP),  perform the reads mapping with bismarker(https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/tree/master/Docs). In this subsampled file, how many reads are unaligned and how many CpGs, CHGs, and CHHs are methylated?**

<u>**Instructions:**</u>

1. (0.5 pt) Make your own working directory in your local home folder. Download bismarker and 'install' it https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark#installation. Note that the latest version is written in perl language, so execute the program by either `/absolute/path/to/the/bismark-*/file` or `perl bismark-*` under the corresponding folder.

**Answer**: Used lab instructions found here: [Link](https://github.com/stat115/Lab_2021/blob/main/Lab07/How%20to%20install%20Bismark.pdf).

``` {bash eval=FALSE}
# YOUR BASH SCRIPTS HERE

```





2.  Prepare the genome for Bismark. You can start by copying the hg38 from `/n/stat115/2021/HW1/index/hg38_raw/` to your local machine and build from there (1.5 pt graduate students only). One of the main jobs is to conduct the C-T or G-A conversion. Why are we doing this? (0.5 pt, all students)

**Answer**: First I copy the `hg38` to my local directory. Then I set up cluster computing node. Then I use `bismark_genome_preparation` from Bismark to prepare the genome using documentation from [here](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/tree/master/Docs). The reason for conducting the C-T and G-A conversion is because it provides an appropriate reference genome. The reason for this section (Part I) is because when we do this analysis on a sample, we change the sequence so using the standard human genome wouldn't work when we go to do alignment - in this part, we resolve this issue by making a conversion of our background genome so we have something to do our mapping/realignment. This helps with our goal of identifying the regions that are protected by methylation - this lets know where the methylation events are.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# YOUR BASH SCRIPTS HERE
# copy the hg38 file
cp -r /n/stat115/2021/HW1/index/hg38_raw/ HW4/Q2/

# transitioning from the login node to the computing node
srun --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --mem=64G --cpus-per-task=8 --time=06:00:00 --pty bash -i

# run bismark_genome_preparation
../Bismark-0.23.0/bismark_genome_preparation hg38_raw
```


Attached is the output on the console from `bismark_genome_preparation`

![Bismark Genome Preparation Output](QI.1.2/log.png)


3. (1 pt) Now that we prepared the genome for the question, follow the Bismark docs to run the main bismark functions, then deduplicate and extract the methylations. For undergraduate students, use directly the converted genome `/n/stat115/2021/HW4/p1_data/hg38/` or here `/n/home13/stat115u2102/hw4/setup/hg38_p1/`. What do you see from `perl bismark2report`?

**Answer**: I follow the documentation provided in the slide. As per TA Jiazhen Rong's Slack message responding to whether graduate students can use the converted genome: "Yes you definitely could use the pre-converted genome since I.1.3. But still need to report some important lines of I.1.2's log message after bismark converting step finishes running," I will use the pre-converted genome for this question due to the time needed for I.1.2 to complete. 

``` {bash eval=FALSE}
# YOUR BASH SCRIPTS HERE
# running bismark
perl ../Bismark-0.23.0/bismark --genome /n/stat115/2021/HW4/p1_data/hg38/ /n/stat115/2021/HW4/p1_data/bs_subreads.fastq

# running deduplicate
perl ../Bismark-0.23.0/deduplicate_bismark --bam bs_subreads_bismark_bt2.bam

# extract the methylations
perl ../Bismark-0.23.0/bismark_methylation_extractor --gzip --bedGraph bs_subreads_bismark_bt2.deduplicated.bam

# generating report
perl ../Bismark-0.23.0/bismark2report

# print outputs
cat bs_subreads_bismark_bt2_SE_report.txt
cat bs_subreads_bismark_bt2.deduplication_report.txt

scp stat215u2107@login.rc.fas.harvard.edu:HW4/Q3/bs_subreads_bismark_bt2_SE_report.html "QI.1.3/report.html"
```


From the bismark2report, I get the following `bs_subreads_bismark_bt2_SE_report.txt`, `bs_subreads_bismark_bt2.deduplication_report.txt`, and generated HTML output. As per Bo Yuan's Slack message, I attach screen shots of my results.

![Cytosine Methylation after Extraction](QI.1.3/cytosine2.png)


![M-Bias Plot](QI.1.3/mbias.png)


I observe that only 9.12% of sequences did not map uniquely. The cytosine methylation is majority in CpG context (which is the region where "nucleotides are followed by a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases along its 5' → 3' direction"). There were very few duplicates removed in the deduplication process.



**I.2 (1.5 pts) Methylation in cytosine at promoter regions normally suppresses the gene expression, while H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone modifications at promoter regions imply higher gene expression. We have processed RRBS-seq data on the prostater cancer cell line dataset (https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR859PDD/) and report the high methylation signal sites in `data/Methylation.bed`. Draw violin plots of the expression level of genes with methylation, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac in their promoters. Could you find that the higher methylation signals repress the gene expression?**  

The `/n/stat115/2021/HW4/p1_data/ProstateCancer_H3K4me3_peaks.bed` and `/n/stat115/2021/HW4/p1_data/ProstateCancer_H3K27ac_peaks.bed` are the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks files of prostate cancer. Try to find the intersection of loops and histone modification signal intervals. In the `/n/stat115/2021/HW4/p1_data/Expr_loc.txt`, the first three columns are chromosome coordinates, the fourth column is the gene expression score of a prostate cancer tissue, and the rest columns are the gene symbols.

**Hint1:** Use the preinstalled `bedtools` by calling `module load bedtools2`.

**Hint2:** Use `>` to write your results into an output file. Use `uniq` command to remove the duplicates from your intersections. e.g. `bedtools intersect {YOUR FLAGS} | uniq > OUTPUT.TXT`

**Hint3:** The methylation group might have a lower signal-noise ratio. So drop the genes with very low expression (< 0.0001) and use the log scale when you generate the violin plots for better visualization. You can use `ylim` and `scale_y_log10` from `ggplot`.

**Answer**: The total number of lines for Methylation is 1767 lines, H3K4me3 is 10740 lines, and H3K27ac is 9531 lines. Violin plots are provided below for expression level of genes with methylation, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac in their promoters using the fourth column (the gene expression score of a prostate cancer tissue). I found that the higher methylation signals do repress the gene expression because looking at the violin plot, the Methylation had fewer gene scores in the higher values and more at lower scores (hence it doesn't have a bulb shape at the top or widen at the top compared to the other groups).

# Part II. HiC (5/6 pts)

Genome architecture plays a key role in nuclear functions. The spatial arrangement and proximity of genes have been linked to biological functions, such as gene replication, regulation, and transcription. The Hi-C technique allows researchers to extract the interaction frequency for all loci of a genome at high-throughput and at a genome-wide scale. In this part, we will learn how the HiC data integrates with other epigenetic data and genome architecture affects gene expression in prostate cancer.

**II.1 (2 pts) Given subsampled example fastq files generated by Hi-C technique(`/n/stat115/2021/HW4/p2_data/HiC_fq`), perform reads mapping, filtering, and binning to this data with runHiC(http://xiaotaowang.github.io/HiC_pipeline/quickstart.html). How about the quality of this subsampled data? Could you explain the QC criteria of Hi-C data?**

**Answer**: According to the documentation, the quality control criteria of Hi-C data is Unique-Mapping Ratio (low value of this metric indicates low sequencing quality, sample contamination or incomplete genome assembly), Self-Ligation Ratio, Dangling-Reads Ratio, and Long-Range Ratio (low value ($<0.15$) of this metric indicates the failed experiment). These statistics can help determine the quality of our Hi-C data. Fortunately, we can check the quality of this subsampled data using `runHiC quality`.

<u>**Instructions:**</u>

1. First load the prepared anaconda environment. Make sure use exactly the same version for python and the dependencies. Note the difference from doing the same on local machines, e.g. a laptop or PC.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
module load Anaconda3 python/3.7.7-fasrc01
conda activate /n/stat115/2021/HW4/conda_env37
module load samtools minimap2 bwa sratoolkit
```

**Answer**: Completed.

2. [Optional] The runHiC script takes the bwa index as the input. You can either use the one we used for HW3 `/n/stat115/2021/HW3/bwa_hg38_index` or build your own index separately.

**Answer**: Utilized the bwa and bash commands similar to how I did it in Q1 for HW3. For the sake of consistency, I will stick with the provided bwa index.

3. Note that the index file is **NOT*** the same as the one we used for bismark. What is the main difference between bowtie and bwa in practice? (Hint: https://www.biostars.org/p/134418/). Copy the index to your local dir and build the index.

**Answer**: The main difference between Bowtie and BWA in practice is speed and accuracy of the algorithm. BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. Bowtie is an ultrafast, memory-efficient short read aligner; it aligns short DNA sequences (reads) to the human genome at a rate of over 25 million 35-bp reads per hour. Thus we see BWA and Bowtie are made for different scenarios. In addition, according to the forum discussion, BWA appears to be slower, albeit does a more sensitive search and is more accurate compared to Bowtie. However I also did some additional Google search and found this paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5834436/. The paper "conclude that there is not a single mapper that is ideal in all scenarios but rather the choice of alignment tool should be driven by the application and sequencing technology" in comparing BWA, Bowtie, and other algorithms. 

4. Prepare your working directory with the index files and your metadata file `datasets.tsv`. See http://xiaotaowang.github.io/HiC_pipeline/quickstart.html#create-the-meta-data-file. In our case we would use these following setup configuration. Make sure you have more than one replica sample in your metadata to avoid future ambiguity. If you skipped step 2, copy the prepared index file `/n/stat115/2021/HW4/p2_data/hg38` or `/n/home13/stat115u2102/hw4/setup/hg38_p2` to your wdr directly. Also download `hg38.chrom.sizes` from canvas to your wdr.

```
HiC_subreads GM06990 R1 HindIII
HiC_subreads GM06990 R2 HindIII
```

**Answer**: Bash commands below.

5. Check your wdr, which should have at least the following folders.
```
.
├── hg38
│   ├── hg38.fa
│   ├── hg38.fa.amb
│   ├── hg38.fa.ann

└── datasets.tsv
```

**Answer**: Attached is a screen shot of the directory (as per Bo Yuan's message on Slack, we shouldn't have HiC_subreads and HiC_subreads.complete prior to running runHiC).

![Directory](QII.1/directory.png)

Run the runHiC commands and generate the stats table. Put here the output `*.stats` and plots `*.png` for the summary group `allReps` **ONLY**. What is the message you can read from the results.

**Answer**: The message I can read from the results is provided below. I show the output `*.stats` and plots `*.png` for the summary group `allReps`.

Observing this report, I see we have subpar quality. The Library-size distribution seems inconsistent and the lines on the Pair Type plot don't converge. According to the documentation (http://xiaotaowang.github.io/HiC_pipeline/quality.html), this could indicate we have QC issues with our data.


**II.2 (2 pts) In the II.1, you have learned how to generate a genomic interaction matrix on the example file. Here we provided a genomic interaction data on chr21 in prostate cancer(`data/chr21.chr21_10000.cool`). Normalize this data at 10k resolution and perform loop calling with 10% CTCF model. How many loops with >0.9 confidence can you find? Then draw a genomic contact heatmap to show the interaction in chr21. Are there any highly interactive regions?**

**Hint:** cooler(https://cooler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can perform normalization and peakachu(https://github.com/tariks/peakachu) can perform loop calling on Hi-C data. higlass(https://higlass.io/) may help with visualization.


**Answer**: Using cooler and peakachu, I get there are 78 loops with >0.9 confidence (count the number lines in the resulting bedpe file). Then I used higlass to draw genomic contact heatmap to show the interaction in chr21 (I attached a screenshot of my Jupyter Notebook as well). I also provide the heatmap that was generated by higlass. I found there are highly interactive regions between neighboring genomic regions lead to a strong diagonal pattern in the resulting heatmap.

**II.3 (1 pt) Transcription factors help construct the chromatin loops. With the provided prostate cancer ATAC-seq peaks file(`data/tumor_ATAC_peaks.bed`), could you find the open regions in the loop anchors? What factors bind in the loop anchors? What potential roles may these factors play?**

**II.4 (1 pt, graduates only) Normally histone modification H3K27ac marks the enhancer regions on the genome, and H3K4me3 marks the promoter regions. Use the prostate tumor H3K27ac and H3K4me3 peaks files in I.2 here. Based on the loop file, could you find the loops that contact an enhancer region with a gene promoter region on chr21? Do these target genes express higher than the genes without loops structure?**

# Part III. Hidden Markov Model and TAD boundaries (2 pts)

Topologically associating domains (TADs) define genomic intervals, where sequences within a TAD physically interact more frequently with each other than with sequences outside the TAD. TADs are often defined by HiC (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149993/), an experimental technique designed to study the three-dimensional architecture of genomes. HiC generates PE sequenced data, where the two mate pairs indicate two genomic regions that are might be far apart in the genome, but physically interact with each other. If we look across the genome in bins (40kb in the early paper, but now can go down to 5-10kb with deeper sequencing), we could find reads that are mapped there and check whether their interacting mate pairs are mapped upstream or downstream. In each bin, we can calculate a directional index (DI) to quantify the degree of upstream or downstream bias of a given bin (for more details, see the supplement- `Supplement_10.1038_nature11082.pdf` ). For this HW, we ask you to implement a hidden Markov Model (Viterbi) to find regions with upstream bias (DI < 0) and those with downstream bias (DI > 0), even though the DI in individual bins might have some noise. This way, TAD boundaries could be discovered as clusters of bins from negative DIs to positive DIs (see Supplementary Figure 12b).

For simplicity, we will only have two hidden states (upstream, downstream), and use the following HMM parameters (these do not necessarily capture the real data distribution, but just to help your implementation):

```
Initial probability: upstream = 0.5, downstream = 0.5
Transition probability: Pb(up to up) = Pb(dn to dn) = 0.9, Pb(up to dn) = Pb(dn to up) = 0.1

Emission probabilities:
P{<-1200, [-1200,-800), [-800,-500), [-500,0), [0,500), [-500,800), [800, 1200), >= 1200 | upstream} = (0.01, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.65, 0.15, 0.08, 0.04)
P{<-1200, [-1200,-800), [-800,-500), [-500,0), [0,500), [-500,800), [800, 1200), >= 1200 | downstream} = (0.04, 0.08, 0.15, 0.65, 0.04, 0.02, 0.01, 0.01)

```

**Given the DI file (`data/ESC.Dixon_2015.DI.chr21.txt`), implement and utilize the Viterbi algorithm to predict the hidden states of the Hi-C data. Visualize your result with a graph utilizing the following: midpoint of genomic bin on the x-axis; DI score per bin on the y-axis; color: hidden state of the HMM.**  

**Hint1**: Examples HMM code can be found at:
http://www.adeveloperdiary.com/data-science/machine-learning/implement-viterbi-algorithm-in-hidden-markov-model-using-python-and-r/

**Hint2**: The observations are continuous or have too many discrete values. Try binning them into a few discrete regions. Use `cut` function built in R.

\textbf{Answer}: I first `scp` the file to my local directory.

# Part IV: GWAS Followup (3 pts)

The NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog is a curated dataset of trait-associated genetic variants for human. While it provides association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and trait (i.e. cancer), the genetic variants in GWAS catalog are not necessarily causative or functional for a trait, since SNPs can be highly correlated measured by linkage disequilibrium (LD). To learn the potential functional effect of a certain SNP, especially the non-coding variants, we can use RegulomeDB to explore the potential function of the SNP.

You will explore the following online resources: The NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/), dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/ ), LDLink (https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/), and RegulomeDB (the beta version http://regulomedb.org or the more stable older version http://legacy.regulomedb.org/).
